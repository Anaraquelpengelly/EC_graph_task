In this assignment, I have trained a GNN to do link prediction (classification) of drug-disease edges using the Pytorch Geometric library.
I was unfortunately unable to test against the ground truth in this occasion as I ran out of time. 
There are two notebooks in this assessment, the first one `attempt_pytorch_geometric.ipynb` uses a small sample of the data as a starting point and the second one, `attempt_pytorch_geometric_full_data.ipynb` uses the whole dataset. The model which uses the whole dataset is much better than the model trained with the sample data.
